ü™ô BlOClatCh: The On-Chain Pairing Game

üí° Project Description

BlOClatCh is a simple, educational Solidity smart contract designed to explore one of the most fundamental challenges in blockchain development: generating verifiable randomness for games.

It simulates a basic "flip and match" game where players try to match two hidden "cards" (numbers) drawn by the contract. While it's a fun, lightweight concept, it serves as a critical demonstration of why relying on simple on-chain data for randomness is risky!

üïπÔ∏è What It Does

This contract acts as a decentralized match-making engine:

A player calls the public play() function.

The contract instantly generates two "cards" (pseudo-random numbers between 1 and 10) using block data and the transaction details.

It checks if card1 equals card2.

If they match, the player scores a point, and the contract updates the totalMatches count.

An event is broadcast to the Ethereum network with the result.

‚≠ê Key Features

Simple Game Logic: Easy-to-understand state management for total plays and matches.

Events for Transparency: Uses the GamePlayed event to broadcast the result (the two cards and match status) to the world.

Security Focus: Includes a critical warning highlighting the security flaws of using block.timestamp and keccak256 for randomness in production games, guiding beginners toward secure solutions like Chainlink VRF.

Utility Functions: View functions (getTotalPlays, getTotalMatches) for tracking the game's overall performance.
